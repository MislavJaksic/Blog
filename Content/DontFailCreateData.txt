A goal describes what you want, but also how to fail. You fail by not achieving your goal. Why did you skip working out? Do you not think being fit and healthy is a worthwhile pursuit? You didn't do the "Walkout" exercise. Why? Perhaps you couldn't touch your toes. That's alright. Find a replacement exercise. If you stopped working out, it might be because you didn't have the willpower to overcome procrastination. Change your schedule. Workout when you feel like you have the most energy. Try exercising early in the morning or just before bed.

You said you'd read a book. Why didn't you read? After all, you chose the book. If you set out to read twenty pages and didn't, try reading ten or read for an hour instead. Maybe it became boring halfway through. Alright then. Pick another book.

In each case you can create a data point from which solutions and ideas will spring. Feeling disappointed or powerless is both unhelpful and untrue. Each failure has data points from which you can learn a lesson. Attend the lesson, so that you know what to do in the future.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, perhaps you've never failed. Then you set yourself an easy goal and are cheating yourself. It is much better to set yourself a lofty goal, try to realize your true potential and fail, then it is to never try because you fear you will fail. Aim to fail about half the time. Think of failure as a data point. Collect them, write them down, think about them. How can you remove an obstacle? Did you have enough willpower to overcome procrastination? Perhaps the goals you set yourself are no longer meaningful. No worries. It's time to change your goals. Make them challenging and meaningful. Review your goals often: both how you succeeded and how you fail... no!; created a data point.
