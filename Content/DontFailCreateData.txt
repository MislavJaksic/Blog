A goal describes what you want, but also how to fail. You fail by not achieving your goal. Why didn't you workout? Do you not think being fit and healthy is a worthwhile pursuit? You didn't do the "Walkout" exercise. Why? Perhaps you couldn't touch your toes. That's alright. Find a replacement exercise. If you stopped working out, it might be because you didn't have the willpower to overcome procrastination. Change your schedule. Workout when you feel like you have the most energy. Try exercising early in the morning or just before bed. You said you'd read a book. Why don't you read? After all, you chose the book. If you set out to read twenty pages and didn't, try reading ten or read for an hour instead. Maybe it became boring halfway through. Alright then. Pick another book.

If you've never failed, then the goals you set yourself are too easy. When you fail, feeling ashamed or powerless isn't going to help. Rather, think of failure as a data point. Collect them, write them down, think about them. How can you remove an obstacle? Did you have enough willpower to overcome procrastination? Perhaps the goals you set yourself are no longer meaningful. No worries. Change them. Have challenging, meaningful goals. Review them often, both how you succeeded and how you create a data point.

If you've never failed, your goals are too easy.
