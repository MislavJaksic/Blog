In high school I wanted to be a doctor. I failed the entrance exam. My friend called me and said: "Hey, you've got good grades in math and physics. Why don't you study computer science?". He reminded me of a dream I've had when I was in kindergarten. I wanted to make my own video game. I enrolled in a computer science program. When I got my bachelor's degree, I wanted to be a data scientist. During my master's program my mentor told me he didn't want me doing data science. He'd have me study databases. I switched mentors. Now I'm studying microservices. After university, I did consulting and research and development. This is what I still do at the time of writing. I have no idea what comes next.

After primary school you'll be told to make your first big decision: where do you want to go to high school? If you don't know, pick the same high school as your best friend. That's what I did and I never regreted my choice. Later in life, you'll be told that you have to show passion during a job interview. Fake it. You might want the job because it pays well. Maybe you'll become passionate about it while working. Or not and you'll switch companies.

If you don't know what you want to do when you grow up; if you can't point to a person you admire; if you can't decide what you want to study for the next five years, stop worrying. I don't know how many heads had the same thought. Maybe we're the only two people in the world who feel like this. So what? We still want to contribute to society, we still want to feed ourselves, we still want to help those who depend on us.

If instead of a career or a job you want abstract things like money or power, pursue them. See what pays well or how to persuade others. If you want to be happy or fulfilled, spend time thinking how to bring these into reality. Look for opportunities. Pay attention to what life throws at you. Live day by day. Who knows what tomorrow might bring? Go with the flow.
