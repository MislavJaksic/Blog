There is no difference between thinking and writing. Thinking is forming words, conversing with your mind. Writing is materializing thoughts onto paper. If you improve either, you will improve both. If you are looking for a place to start, look no further then Steven Pinker's The Sence of Style, a style manual. It's bursting with linguistic advice for the 21st century. I'll share the most impactful advice.

Omit needless words! Be concise, respect your readers' time and eyes and pick your words carefully. Word choice determines the speed at which you can transmit an idea. Use uncommon, vivid and colorful language. Instead of very big, two words, discard very and change big to gigantic or cyclopean. The meaning doesn't change, but the later summons an image of a towering mythological creature.

Don't signpost or meta-discuss! Imagine if I started the first paragraph with: "Many people wrote about writing. In this blog post, I'll write about ...". That's signposting: writing about what you will write next. State your topic as soon as possible: what did you discover, what question are you answering? Soon after, state your point: what are you trying to convey? Reel your readers in, make an entrance.

Write in classic style. Imagine a reader talking to you. Orient their gaze through a window. On the other side, paint the world. Engage the mind's eye: conjure images with unusual and precise descriptions. Be direct. Think about actors and objects, concrete, everyday events. Don't argue or talk out loud. Patiently wait until they see the truth.

Avoid the curse of knowledge. It's difficult to image how someone else doesn't know what you know. Just trying to imagine the reader won't help: that's the curse. But don't despair, there is a treatment. Show your writing to another person or after a week, show the draft to yourself. Gather feedback. Maybe you used abbreviations or jargon. Perhaps you used a fancy word where a plain one would do. Improve what you wrote and repeat the exercise until you are confident your readers will understand your ideas.

Good writer are avid readers. Read, read, read. It doesn't matter if it's fiction, for fun or on the job. What matters is the expansion your word pallet. If you just have green, everything will look like a jungle, a mess that can only be disentangled with a machete. Add a splash of color by reading something unusual. Writing is a skill like any other, it takes practice. What matters is that you do a little bit every so often.

For budding writers and avid thinkers.
