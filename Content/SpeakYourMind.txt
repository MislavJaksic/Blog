Take note when you feel an intense emotional reaction. It's your body telling you to pay attention. It can happen during a conversation, a song, when you recite a poem or read an article. Maybe you disagree with the author. Maybe they offered a false explanation. Equally likely, maybe a song-smith revealed an unalterable truth, a thought that can only be expressed through music. Write your reaction and when it happened. Why? Because you stumbled across something profound. These events are rare and are most likely to produce a masterpiece. You need to think and express your thoughts in writing. The process of writing and editing will sharpen your agreement and disagreement with the source of your inspiration. Remember how you felt when you first encountered the idea. Tap into this infinitely pool of motivation.

I can recall with great clarity when I last sipped from the pool. Here's the note: I was watching the wind rustling leaves of a chestnut tree when a question rattled in my head. If I was sitting in an auditorium, disagreeing with the speaker, why should I take the risk of standing up and saying what I think? Because I might know something that others don't. Thomas Paine demonstrated this risk and the principle by speaking his mind during two revolutions. He wanting the American Revolution to be more revolutionary and the French Revolution to the less revolutionary.

For Paine, the American Revolution was necessary and desirable. He wrote a pamphlet Common Sense advocating independence from the Crown when, at the time, everyone wants to gain representatives in parliament. Paine though that, not only would this not happen, it's undesirable. The Colonies should unite and become its own independent country. He described the words government and society from first principles. He began by writing: "Society is produced by our wants, and government by wickedness; the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections, the latter negatively by restraining our vices.". Knowing full well that his ideas would be met with hostility he wrote in the opening paragraph: "Time makes more converts then reason.".

To make sure I never forget the importance of intellectual courage and risk-taking I translated another one of his death-inviting speeches. It was uttered by Paine at the most intense moment of the French Revolution: what should be done with the King, Louis Carpet, who just failed to escape France? Paine, who didn't know French, opposed the execution of Louis Carpet in front of the French National Convention in 1792.. He said, as long as the King is alive, there can be no pretender to the French throne. Instead of death, the King should be banished to the United States, a county that just gained independence, where he could see what just rule looks like. King Louis deserves this, not because he isn't corrupt, tyrannical or full of vices, but because he shares the blame with his government and the citizen's assembly that restored his absolute powers after he abdicated. You can only imagine what the faces of his listeners must have looked like.

Here you can read the translation and the original speech made by Paine. Now it's your turn to gamble and make a masterpiece.
